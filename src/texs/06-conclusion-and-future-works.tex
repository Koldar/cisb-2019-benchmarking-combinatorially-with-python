\begin{frame}{Conclusions and Future Works}
    In conclusion:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item We have developed \code{phd-tester}, an extensible framework to combinatorially testing algorithms, parametrized both in regard of what we're testing and of the environment of the test;
        \item proposed a naming convention of files which is both human readable and software parsable (\code{KS001});
        \item developed a mechanism to concurrently computed generated data and plot it;
        \item \textbf{Future works:} integrate MySQL as data source; generate automatic pdf reports of the tests done; Use a CSP to build the option graph. See \code{https://github.com/Koldar/phdTester/issues} for further works to be done.
    \end{itemize}
